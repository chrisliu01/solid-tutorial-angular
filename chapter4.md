# Chapter 4 - Solid Words

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will expand the previous tutorial video into a real world useful app, one for word training and vocabulary.

*What you will learn*

* How to structure JavaScript in several parts
* How to set up a turtle data file on github
* How to use localStorage to save state
* How to automatically remember a user and login
* How to prepare language files to be used in vocab training
* How to add audio to apps
* How to generate statistics

## The App

The next tutorial is an app that is used to learn vocabulary in a foreign language.  A file is prepared containing the 10,000 most common words in a target language.  The source for word frequency was [wictionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists).  For this demo I have used the czech language with english, but any language pair is possible.
